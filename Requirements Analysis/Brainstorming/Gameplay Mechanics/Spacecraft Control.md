# Details of Spacecraft Controls



## Control Modes
There are two different control modes. The modes can be interchanged while flying, so that a fast transition between arcade and realistic control is possible.
## Acarde Mode
In this mode, the player is only directing the ships flight path and target speed. The ship itself is controlled by an automatic piloting system. The physics model of the ship is still the same as it is, when using realistic flight mode.
#### Instruments and HUD



## Simulation Mode
In this mode the player has full control over the maneuvering system of the ship. He can make sharper turns and more turbulent maneuver as in arcade mode, but has to counteract the ships behaviours to keep it in control.

## Autopilot
For longer travel the ship can be set to autopilot. In this mode the ship flies a long of given waypoints.

## Damage affecting controls


## Storage load affecting controls
The center of mass is defined by the positioning of the storage inside of the ship. Moreover, the heavier the ship, the more power is needed to accelerate and rotate.

Depending on the kind of freight, momentum can get caught by the freight itself (e.g fluids starting to rotate inside of the container).
